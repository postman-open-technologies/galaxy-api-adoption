# Postman Galaxy - API Adoption Training

This project is designed to support Postman training sessions. The API returns learning content for display inside Postman using the Postman visualizer. The API is complemented by a Postman template to guide learners through the steps to reach learning outcomes for the session. The API is deployed on [https://galaxy-api-adoption.postman.training/](https://galaxy-api-adoption.postman.training/).

## Contribution and usage

You can contribute to both the API and the [collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-galaxy-training/collection/9065401-b0c7f820-b6ea-440f-8d5a-c0df01f59826). The experience is designed to teach the learning outcomes indicated by the Galaxy API Adoption badge criteria so please keep this in mind with any content changes. Trainee submissions also need to be testable by automation (learners submit their collection links and we run a script on the collection JSON to ensure that it contains required elements) so any changes to the completed template will need to be accommodated by the submission testing process.

To contribute to the API:

- Fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/galaxy-api-adoption).
- Make and test your changes.
- Once your changes are pushed to GitHub, open a pull request to merge them into the main repo (tip: include a link to your deployed app for testing).

## Feedback
